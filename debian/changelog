    - Fixed race condition on creation shared library symbolic links when make
      runs parallel. Thanks to Yann E. MORIN <yann.morin.1998@free.fr>.

    build-depend on topgit and make tries to build this missing file using
    implicit rule with dh producing spurious errors in log.
  * For libustr-doc added Multi-Arch: foreign.
